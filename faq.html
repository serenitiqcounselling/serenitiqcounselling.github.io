            <h3>Who has access to this service?</h3><br>
            <p>The service is open to anyone (although majorly for young women) who is struggling with emotional and
                psychological
                trauma, or at the risk of developing one. By projection, it is readily available to anyone who is prone to
                suicidal tendencies.
            </p><br>
            <h3>When can this services be accessed?</h3><br>
            <p>
                Our services are available for accessibility round the clock. Due to the sensitivity of issues involved with
                mental
                issues, we have mental social workers and professionals standy always ready to attend to the public. <br>
                Neverthesless, our professional psychologists might only be available to render their professional services
                at
                stipulated time between 8 am - 5 pm.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>What does it take to benefit from this program?</h3> <br>
            <p>
                Literally nothing! <br> You need our help in any way (mental health-related), no matter how
                socially-prejudiced
                it might seem? you got it. We are out to help as much young women as we can overcome the bane of mental
                illness,
                and beyond that, be mentally aware.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Do I get to pay for the services rendered?</h3> <br>
            <p>
                Absolutely not!
                All services rendered are acts of volunteering by well meaning and sympathetic social workers out to birth a
                society rid of every trace of mental illness and stigma associated with it. <br>
                However, sponsorship are fully appreciated.
            </p><br>
